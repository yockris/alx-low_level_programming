Project: C - Singly Linked Lists


This directory contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of singly linked lists.

Tasks ğŸ“‹

Task 0: Print a List
ğŸ“„ File: 0-print_list.c
Implement a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list. If the str is NULL, it should print [0] (nil).

Create a function that returns the number of elements in a list_t list.

Write a function to add a new node at the end of a list_t list. The str value should be duplicated, and it should return the address of the new element.

Task 3: Free a List

Implement a function to free a list_t list, ensuring there are no memory leaks.
